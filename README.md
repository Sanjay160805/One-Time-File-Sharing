# 📁 One Time File Sharing System

This project allows users to upload and share files **securely** with **one-time access** using a **QR code** and a **unique link**. Once the file is accessed, it **self-destructs** (becomes unavailable). It is designed with a **Streamlit frontend**, a **Flask backend**, and uses **MariaDB** as the database.
